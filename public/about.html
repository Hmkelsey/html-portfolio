<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm a full-stack web developer, and I'm all about creating web applications that not only look great but also work like a charm. I've got a knack for the front-end stuff, like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and I absolutely love making websites that adapt beautifully to any device. But it's not just about appearances; I've got the back-end covered too. I work with technologies like Node.js, Express.js, Python with Django, and PHP with Laravel. Plus, I'm no stranger to databases - MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, you name it. I'm a stickler for clean code, and I pour my heart into building web experiences that are top-notch in both quality and performance.</p>

<p>My journey as a web developer has been quite the adventure. I've had the pleasure of diving into a wide range of projects, from crafting e-commerce platforms to custom web apps. It's taught me that collaboration is key, and I thrive on being part of a team. I'm all about learning and staying on top of the latest web trends. When I'm not coding, I'm spending time with my family and labrador Otis.</p>
